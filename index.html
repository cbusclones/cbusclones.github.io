This initial AWS observability framework is intended to provide broad monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities across Nationwide’s AWS ecosystem. The services are structured to enable: 
- Foundational, always on tooling as part of the deployment pipeline  - Observability that spans end-users, applications, and underlying infrastructure including native AWS services and network transits - BSA/App accountability and responsibility for enabling alerting to their desired level. Refer to the “default alerting” and “additional info” links in table 1 for information on how to enable and refine alerts. Best practices & patterns are available for streamlining baseline implementation. - Flexibility to enhance baseline monitoring capabilities using existing tooling, or through new capabilities and tooling within the constructs of Nationwide’s cloud ecosystem and policies - Data to support broad analysis use cases across business, application, infrastructure, and security
